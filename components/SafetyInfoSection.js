          Reporting a crime is an important part of keeping our communities
          safe. By reporting a crime, you can help law enforcement to identify,
          investigate, and prosecute criminals. You can also help to protect
          yourself, your family, and your neighbors from becoming victims of
          crime. Reporting a crime also allows law enforcement to track and
          analyze crime trends, which can help them to be more effective in
          preventing and solving future crimes. Finally, by reporting a crime,
          you can help to ensure justice is served and that the perpetrators of
          the crime are held accountable.
